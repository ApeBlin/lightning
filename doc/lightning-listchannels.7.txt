NAME
----
lightning-listchannels - Command for returning data on active lightning
channels..

SYNOPSIS
--------
*listchannels* ['short_channel_id']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *listchannels* RPC command returns data on channels that are known to the
node.

If no 'short_channel_id' is supplied, then data on all lightning channels that
are known to this node, are returned.

Supplying 'short_channel_id' will filter the results to only return data on a
channel with a matching 'short_channel_id', if one exists.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, an object with a "channels" key is returned containing a list of 0
or more objects.

Each object in the list contains the following data:
- 'source' - The node that initiated the channel creation
- 'destination' - The node that was the target of the channel creation
- 'short_channel_id' - The channel identifier
- 'public' - Boolean value, is publicly available
- 'satoshis' - 
- 'message_flags' - 
- 'channel_flags' - 
- 'active' - 					
- 'last_update' -
- 'base_fee_millisatoshi' -
- 'fee_per_millionth' -
- 'delay' -

If 'shcort_channel_id' is supplied and no matching channels are found, a
"channels" object with an empty list is returned.

ERRORS
------
If 'short_channel_id' is not a valid short_channel_id, an error message will be
returned:

	{ "code" : -32602, "message" : "'short_channel_id' should be a short
	channel id, not '...'" }
